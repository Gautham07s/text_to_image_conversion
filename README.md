# Text-to-Image Generation 🚀🖼️

This project showcases a simple yet powerful **Text-to-Image** generation pipeline built using deep learning.  
By inputting any **text prompt**, the model generates a corresponding **realistic image**.

## ✨ Features
- Generate stunning images from any custom text.
- Supports a wide variety of prompts — from simple objects to complex scenes.
- Easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook with minimal setup.
- Built with popular libraries like Hugging Face 🤗 and Diffusers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers / Diffusers
- PyTorch
